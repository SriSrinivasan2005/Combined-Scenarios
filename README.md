# Combined-Scenarios

# Aim:
To practice solution ideation by generating multiple low-fidelity ideas for a known UX problem, create user stories based on personas, develop narrative scenarios, design task flow diagrams, and perform information architecture activities like card sorting and site mapping for a chosen website or app.

# Output:

# Result:
Multiple low-fidelity ideas were generated through ideation exercises for the chosen UX problem. User stories were written to reflect persona goals, and detailed scenarios were created to describe user context and emotions. Task flow diagrams mapped user actions clearly, and information architecture was organized through card sorting, resulting in a well-structured site map.
